# LDLT Guidelines

The encoding guidelines in this repository are part of the [Digital Latin Library](http://digitallatin.org) project. They are for use by editors wishing to encode critical editions of Latin texts. 

The canonical document is [LDLT-Guidelines.xml](https://github.com/DigitalLatin/guidelines/blob/master/LDLT-Guidelines.xml). That file is the basis for the .docx, .odt, and .pdf documents available in this repository. They were created using the [TEI stylesheets](https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets).

An HTML version of the LDLT Guidelines is available at [https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/LDLT-Guidelines.html](https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/LDLT-Guidelines.html). It contains the full schema for LDLT editions. It was generated using the [DLL Stylesheets](https://github.com/DigitalLatin/DLL-Stylesheets).
