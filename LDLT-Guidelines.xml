            <head>Structure of an LDLT Edition</head>
            <p>This section describes the basic structure of the file that contains an edition for
               the Digital Latin Library's <bibl><title>Library of Digital Latin
                  Texts</title></bibl> (LDLT). The structure of an LDLT edition resembles the
               structure of a traditional printed critical edition:</p>
            <list>
               <head>Parts of an LDLT Edition</head>
               <item>Publication Details</item>
               <item>Front Matter</item>
               <item>Critical Text (including apparatus)</item>
               <item>Indices</item>
            </list>
            <p>Since every text is unique, not every LDLT edition will have all of these sections.
               The nature of the text and the editor's judgment will determine the contents of an
               edition. The purpose of this section is to define the parts of an LDLT edition and
               provide guidelines for representing them in XML.</p>
            <p>These guidelines are based on the standard established by the Text Encoding
               Initiative (TEI), with modification and customization to accommodate the special
               characteristics of Latin texts.</p>

               <p>Since a critical edition is often based upon many sources (e.g., manuscripts,
                  previous editions, commentaries, etc.), the <gi>teiHeader</gi> for an LDLT edition
                  does not hew strictly to the TEI guidelines for <gi>sourceDesc</gi>. The sources
                  for an LDLT edition are documented and described in the edition's front
                  matter.</p>
               <p>Just as an editor is not expected to create the title page and document the
                  publication information, this section of an LDLT is the responsibility of the DLL
                  staff.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Front matter -->

            <div xml:id="front-matter">
               <head>Front Matter</head>
               <p>The <gi>front</gi> contains divisions and subdivisions (using <gi>div</gi>)
                  corresponding to the preface, bibliography, and conspectus for the edition.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="bold">preface</hi> lays out (in prose, using <gi>p</gi>) the
                  argument for the edition. It also describes the textual tradition and the major
                  sources for it, which is why it is recommended to compile the bibliography first,
                  to take advantage of the ability to link to individual entries in the
                  bibliography, so that users will be able to have the information available as they
                  read.</p>
               <p>The elements available in all TEI documents are available for use in the preface.
                  For example, an editor might want to make a table comparing the readings of
                  manuscript families. In that case, the editor would use <gi>table</gi> and its
                  related elements (see the TEI guidelines for <ref
                     target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-table.html"
                        ><gi>table</gi></ref> for more information).</p>

               <head>Bibliography</head>
               <!-- Issue: Should a consensus siglum be an xml:id on a <listBibl> containing the items, or a separate siglum listed elsewhere? -->
               <p>The bibliography presents opportunities for leveraging the digital nature of an
                  LDLT edition. For this reason, every item in the bibliography is encoded as
                  structured data (contained in <gi>witness</gi> or <gi>bibl</gi>), so that the
                  bibliography itself can become a useful tool for finding and using resources,
                  especially those that are available online.</p>
               <p xml:id="zotero">The bibliography is all the more useful as a tool if it is created
                  and made available via <ref target="http://www.zotero.org">Zotero</ref>, an open,
                  online resource for building and managing bibliographies. It is highly
                  recommended, but not required, that all LDLT editions have a corresponding Zotero
                  repository for their bibliography.</p>

                     refer to a scholar whose unpublished notes appear in a commentary or who has
                     corresponded with the editor. For ease of reference, these sources should be

                     other materials in the bibliography. For example, single letters, or <emph
                        rend="italic">sigla</emph>, stand for manuscripts, and the last names of
                     scholars stand for editions, commentaries, or other works of scholarship.
                     Centuries of use have demontrated that this system of sigla and other symbols
                     and abbreviations is an efficient, effective, and economical way of presenting
                     the complex information contained in critical editions. Although its
                     development was motivated by the constraints of the printed page, its virtues
                     for representing data commend it for other media, too. But just as the printed
                     page has limits, so too does the digital file, which means that the traditional
                     system requires an update to make it available in a digital context.</p>

                  <p>Given some guidance and experience, people can learn how to navigate the system
                     of letters, numbers, symbols, and other typographical conventions for referring
                     to the sources of a crticial edition. If one edition uses superscript numerals
                     to indicate the hands that wrote in a manuscript, but another uses superscript
                     numerals to signify the number of a manuscript in a collection, a human reader
                     can adjust to the difference in meaning without much effort. In contrast,
                     machines need clear instructions and a reliable set of rules for reading a
                     digital file. For example, a human might see <hi rend="bold">N²</hi> and
                     correctly interpret it within a particular edition as meaning "text written by
                     the second in a succession of people who wrote in the manuscript known as codex
                     Neapolitanus V A 8." Without explicit instructions, a machine will interpret
                     the same information as simply the letter "N" with a superscript numeral 2 next
                     to it. Indeed, a less experienced human reader might reach the same conclusion
                     as the machine.</p>

                  <p>Since the audience for LDLT editions includes an entirely new class of reader
                     (i.e., machines), it stands to reason that the reference system should be
                     adapted to accommodate the needs of the expanded readership. For this reason,
                     LDLT editions encode sigla and other aspects of the traditional reference
                     system in two ways: a machine-readable version (using <att>xml:id</att>) and a
                     human-readable version (using <gi>abbr</gi>, with special instructions for
                     rendering typographical conventions such as superscript and subscript
                     notation). In some cases, the values for both will be the same, but the <ref
                        target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-id/">strict rules of the XML specification
                        for <att>xml:id</att></ref> do not allow for the traditional system of
                     combining letters with superscript and/or subscript numerals. Nevertheless, the
                     values of <att>xml:id</att> and <gi>abbr</gi> should be similar, if not
                     identical, to each other, and they should be meaningful. Editors should follow
                     the conventions in previous editions of the same text, changing a siglum only
                     if it is important to the edition's argument to do so. If the text has never
                     been edited, the editor should choose sigla according to the principles
                     outlined by <ref target="#West">West</ref> (74–75). In brief, use sigla that
                     have mnemonic value (e.g., "V" for "Vaticanus" or "P" for "Parisinus").</p>

                  <p>Because the needs of editors will vary from edition to edition, the LDLT does
                     not have strict rules for representing manuscript hands or similar information.

                  <head>Manuscripts</head>
                  <p>The description of manuscripts is a discipline unto itself, with
                     long-established conventions for capturing all of the details about not only a
                     manuscript's contents, but also its dimensions, provenance, material, and other
                     physical details. It is customary for critical editions to provide a brief
                     prose description of the major manuscripts used for establishing the text,
                     usually only enough to identify where the manuscript may be found for
                     consultation, but sometimes including information about its provenance and
                     other details relevant to the edition (e.g., manuscript hands).</p>
                  <p>The prose format for describing manuscripts is a predictable and efficient way
                     of conveying this information to human readers, but it is not useful for making
                     the information available to machines for processing. That is why the TEI
                     guidelines have an entire module for making manuscript descriptions available
                     as structured data for machine-readability (<ref
                        target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html">10
                        Manuscript Description</ref>). The following guidelines are a customization
                     of that module for LDLT editions.</p>
                  <p>These guidelines establish a minimum requirement for describing a manuscript
                     for an LDLT edition so that the information can be processed and displayed as
                     expected. They also include instructions for encoding a finer degree of detail.
                     Above all, the point is to make the information available to both human and
                     machine readers, so it is up to individual editors to use their best judgment
                     regarding the amount of information that will be relevant to those seeking to
                     understand the place of a manuscript in the tradition.</p>

                                       with the number of each eclogue, but Calpurnius' sixth
                                       eclogue lacks a subscription, and the following is written at
                                       the end of the seventh: <quote xml:lang="la">explicit sexta

                                          eclogue of Calphurnius</quote>). This is explained by the
                                       fact that the seventh eclogue follows the sixth without any
                                       break, with the result that only six eclogues are attributed
                                       to Calpurnius in this manuscript. But in the margin, where
                                       the sixth eclogue ought to end, the copyist has added the

                  <p>The bibliography for early editions, modern editions, commentaries,
                     translations, articles, notes, and other materials cited in the edition should
                     be formatted according to latest edition of <bibl><title>The Chicago Manual of
                           Style</title></bibl>. As noted <ref target="#zotero">elsewhere in these
                        guidelines</ref>, it is recommended that editors use <ref
                        target="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</ref> to manage the bibliography for
                     LDLT editions, not least because Zotero can export the bibliography in Chicago
                     style.</p>
                  <p>Items should be categorized and listed in groups for ease of reference. For
                     example, previous editions should be listed separately from commentaries and
                     articles. Depending on the nature of the material, it may be useful to
                     subdivide previous editions into early and modern editions.</p>
                  <p>In keeping with the goal of human- and machine-readability, individual items in
                     the bibliography should also be encoded in XML. To meet the <hi rend="bold"
                        >minimum requirement</hi> for LDLT editions, individual items in the
                     bibliography should be enclosed with <gi>bibl</gi> and they should have human-
                     and machine-readable abbreviations (sigla), using <gi>abbr</gi> and
                        <att>xml:id</att> respectively. See the <ref target="bibliography-sigla"
                        >section on sigla</ref> for more information.</p>

                  <p>For maximum functionality, it is strongly recommended to encode a greater
                     degree of bibliographical detail, using the following:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item><gi>editor</gi> or <gi>author</gi></item>
                     <item><gi>title</gi></item>
                     <item><gi>pubPlace</gi> (place of publication)</item>
                     <item><gi>publisher</gi></item>
                     <item><gi>date</gi></item>
                     <item><gi>ptr</gi> (pointer, for the URL of a digital copy, if
                        available)</item>
                  </list>

                  <p>The following sections demonstrate the recommended encoding for common types of
                     records in a bibliography.</p>


                  <!-- Bibliography: editions -->

                  <div xml:id="bibliography-editions">
                     <head>Editions</head>
                     <p>To make the most of the functionality supported by the LDLT and to remain
                        true to its data model, previous editions should be classified in one of two
                        categories: early editions based on a single manuscript, and modern critical
                        editions based on more than one source. This will have consequences for how
                        the editions are handled in the apparatus criticus (see below, <ref
                           target="apparatus-criticus-patterns">Apparatus Criticus</ref>). The
                        distinction should be preserved in the bibliography with the use of two
                        different kinds of lists: <gi>listWit</gi> for early editions, and
                           <gi>listBibl</gi> for modern editions. In both types of list, the items
                        should be presented in chronological order.</p>

                     <div xml:id="bibliography-editions-early">
                        <head>Early Editions</head>
                        <p>Since it is often the case that an early edition is a witness to a single
                           manuscript that might otherwise be lost, they are encoded in the
                           bibliography with <gi>witness</gi>. Accordingly, they must be grouped in
                              <gi>listWit</gi>. Since they are also printed books, they also require
                           the use of <gi>bibl</gi> and its related elements.</p>

                              (e.g., Lipsiae instead of Leipzig). If the place is unknown, the value

                              translated. If the name is not known, <gi>editor</gi> contains the
                              word "Anonymous."</item>
                           <item><gi>title</gi> contains either the name by which the edition is

                           <item><gi>date</gi> contains the date in arabic numerals (e.g., 1504, not
                              MDIV or CIↃIↃIV). If the date is unknown, the value should be "s.d."
                                 (<foreign xml:lang="la">sine die</foreign>). If the date is known,
                              but not explicitly printed in the edition, put the date in square

            <head>Edition Text</head>
            <p>The edition text corresponds to the text printed "above the line" of the apparatus in
               a traditional edition. It is composed of lemmata, that is, text judged by the editor
               to be authentic, accurate, and/or authoritative.</p>
            <p>There may be more than one authoritative version of a text, depending on the text and
               depending on the approach adopted by the editor. Authors sometimes edit and revise
               their work over time. Scribes often record the version of the text that makes sense
               in their context. Scholars and other readers offer conjectures for problematic
               passages. But an editor must make decisions about the text an edition presents to
               readers. Combined, those decision constitute the editor's argument about the text,
               and they are on display in the official edition text in its initial state.</p>
            <p>"Initial state" is an important phrase. Since the online version of an LDLT allows
               readers to swap readings from the critical apparatus into the main text, it is
               possible to encounter many versions of the text in one viewing of it, but the
               official edition text in its default initial state (i.e., what you see when you open
               the edition for the first time) is the starting point for those interactions.</p>
            <p>This section establishes guidelines for encoding the information typically found in
               the main text of a critical edition.</p>
            <div xml:id="edition-text-prose">
               <head>Prose</head>
               <p>The aim of this section is to provide guidance for marking up the structure of
                  prose texts, using the generic model of book, chapter, and paragraph for the main
                  components of a work.</p>
               <p>In a traditional critical edition, numbers are printed in the margin and/or in the
                  text itself. It is often unclear whether the numbers are meant to mark syntactic
                  units, reflect the numbering of pages or sections in a canonical edition, or
                  something else entirely. An advantage to semantically encoding the reference
                  scheme is that it makes the scheme's significance explicit. For that reason, a
                  human- and machine-readable reference scheme is essential for an LDLT edition.
                  Moreover, if the structure is not encoded according to these guidelines, search
                  and browse functionality will not be supported.</p>

               </p>

               <p>For an LDLT edition of a prose text, the top-level <gi>div</gi> has the
                     <att>type</att> "edition"; this division contains the entire text of the
                  edition. The next <gi>div</gi> will normally have the <att>type</att> "textpart"
                  with <att>subtype</att> "book" and <att>n</att> to indicate the number of the
                  book. If a different division scheme is required, editors should consult the DLL
                  staff.</p>

               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

               </egXML>

               <p><gi>milestone</gi> may be used to mark the sections of a canonical edition, if the
                  current edition uses a different scheme.</p>
               <p><gi>p</gi> (paragraph) contains the text of a chapter or other basic section in a
                  prose work. <att>n</att> must be used to reflect the numbering scheme of the
                  edition. Note that the TEI Guidelines define the paragraph as <quote
                     source="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#COPA">the
                     fundamental organizational unit for all prose texts</quote>. The unique
                  characteristics of some texts may require a different approach. In those cases,
                  editors should work with DLL staff to identify the best way to encode the text in
                  question.</p>

               <head>People</head>
               <p>It can be useful to encode names of people mentioned in the text of an edition,
                  whether to facilitate the creation of an index or to support digital search
                  functionality. It is up to the editor to decide which names, if any, should be
                  encoded. If names are to be encoded, the following guidelines should be
                  observed.</p>

               <p>
                  <specDesc key="listPerson"/>
                  <specDesc key="person"/>
                  <specDesc key="persName"/>
               </p>

               <p><gi>listPerson</gi> (list of persons) contains a list of names of people mentioned
                  in the text. This list must be maintained by the editor as names are encoded in
                  the edition.</p>
               <p><gi>person</gi> contains the nominative form of the name of a person mentioned in
                  the text. It must also have <att>xml:id</att> with a machine-readable version of
                  the name to serve as a reference point for instances of the name in the text.</p>
               <p><gi>persName</gi> contains the name of a person, regardless of case.</p>
               <p><gi>note</gi> contains further identifying information about the person (e.g.,
                  dates, the ID number in a reference work or prosopography), if the name is not
                  enough to make the distinction.</p>

               <p>Since names may appear in different cases in the text, it is vital to have a
                  reference list of names in the nominative form. While working on a text, editors
                  should consider which names, if any, should appear in an index and establish a
                  working list of names in the nominative case. At this stage, it is worthwhile to
                  start an XML document for names, using <gi>listPerson</gi>, <gi>person</gi>, and
                     <gi>persName</gi> as described above:</p>

               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <listPerson>
                     <person xml:id="Absyrtus">
                        <persName>Absyrtus</persName>
                        <note>Medeae frater</note>
                     </person>
                     <person xml:id="Accius">
                        <persName>Accius</persName>
                        <note>Poeta</note>
                     </person>
                     <person xml:id="Actaeon">
                        <persName>Actaeon</persName>
                     </person>
                  </listPerson>
               </egXML>

               <p>Where names of people in the reference list appear in the edition text, they
                  should be encoded with <gi>persName</gi> and <att>ref</att> pointing to the
                     <att>xml:id</att> of the person.</p>

               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

               <p>It is also possible to encode indirect references to people:</p>

               <head>Places</head>
               <p>Place names, and the names of those who inhabit the places, can be encoded in LDLT
                  editions to facilitate creation of an index or to assist readers in identifying
                  the places mentioned in the text. If it is desirable to encode this information,
                  the following guidelines should be followed.</p>

               <p>
                  <specList>
                     <specDesc key="placeName"/>
                     <specDesc key="orgName"/>
                  </specList>
               </p>

               <p><gi>placeName</gi> contains the name of a place, with <att>ref</att> and the
                  canonical Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for it at <ref
                     target="http://pleiades.stoa.org">Pleiades</ref>.</p>
               <p><gi>orgName</gi> (organization name) contains the name of the inhabitants of a

               <p>The following is an extreme example, but it demonstrates what might be encoded and
                  how.</p>

               <p>The apparatus criticus is where editors assemble the variant readings from

                  <head>Readings</head>

                  <p>In the context of a critical edition, "reading" is the generic term for any
                     unit of information that has meaning in constituting the text of the edition. A
                     critical edition contains two types of reading: lemma and variant.</p>

                  <p xml:id="lemma">A <hi rend="bold">lemma</hi> is a word or phrase (or the absence
                     thereof) judged by the editor to be authentic, accurate, and/or authoritative.
                     It may be attested by documentary sources (e.g., a manuscript, an early
                     edition) or it may be an emendation. Lemmata constitute the text printed in the
                     main portion of a critical edition.</p>

                  <p xml:id="variant">A <hi rend="bold">variant reading</hi> is some a word or
                     phrase (or absence thereof) judged by the editor to be unsatisfactory for
                     linguistic and/or stylistic reasons, but of interest in establishing the text.
                     These readings are "variants" insofar as they vary from what the editor has
                     judged to be the lemmata. A variant reading may be attested by a manuscript or
                     it may be a conjecture or a correction. Variant readings constitute the text
                     printed in the apparatus criticus.</p>

                  <p xml:id="emendation">An <hi rend="bold">emendation</hi> is a reading that is not
                     supported by documentary evidence, but is expressly proposed by some person
                     (possibly the editor) and accepted by the editor into the main text of an
                     edition.</p>

                  <p xml:id="conjecture">A <hi rend="bold">conjecture</hi> is a reading that is not
                     supported by known documentary evidence, but is proposed by some person and
                     determined by an editor to be worthy of consideration in establishing the text,
                     but not to be printed in the main text of the edition.</p>

                  <p xml:id="correction"><hi rend="bold">Correction</hi> describes any attempt by
                     the original copyist or some other hand to alter a witness' reading, whether or
                     not the result matches the lemma of the current edition. Whether or not the
                     result of a correction is "correct" is a matter of perspective. Opinions can
                     differ from editor to editor about what the "correct" reading is, which is why
                     having more than one critical edition of a text is not redundant. Similarly,
                     copyists and other users of manuscripts have their own idea of what the
                     "correct" reading is. The original copyist might notice a slip of the pen in
                     his own work and correct it. A later hand might correct a mistake missed by the
                     copyist. Another reader comparing two manuscripts might "correct" one of them
                     based on the other's reading. In all of these cases, the motivation is to
                     correct what is perceived to be incorrect. For all of these reasons,
                     "correction" is used in these guidelines to refer to an attempt to alter
                     existing text so that it conforms to some perceived standard, whether or not
                     that standard matches the editor's view of what the correct reading might be. </p>

                  <p>The next two sections discuss where readings are found, i.e., in witnesses and
                     sources.</p>
               </div>
               <!-- End of section on readings -->

               <div xml:id="witness">
                  <head>Witnesses</head>
                  <p>A <hi rend="bold">witness</hi> may be a manuscript (more properly, the
                     individual hands that wrote in it—see below) or an early printed edition (e.g.,
                     editio princeps) that may preserve the readings of a single manuscript.</p>

                  <p xml:id="hands">The physical object referred to as a manuscript is not itself a
                     witness. Rather, it preserves a record of the activities of the copyist(s),
                     rubricator(s), corrector(s), and/or other annotator(s) who wrote on its pages,
                     each of whom might be a witness to a different exemplar. At the very least,
                     they represent different perceptions of the same exemplar. By synechdoche,
                     those people are referred to as "hands." These hands are not to be confused
                     with the drawings of hands, known as manicules, that sometimes appear in the
                     margins of manuscripts to point out passages of interest. The manuscript's
                     hands are represented by superscript numerals appended to its siglum. A change
                     in number, however, does not necessarily indicate a change of person. For
                     example, the copyist and corrector might be one and the same person, but it can
                     be important to distinguish them, since they represent different views of the
                     text. Unfortunately, confusion arises from the practice of assigning numbers
                     only to hands subsequent to the original copyist. That is, the siglum by itself
                     (i.e., without a superscript numeral) is understood to represent the hand of
                     the original copyist, and every subsequent hand is numbered in descending order
                     from "1". Strictly speaking, the original copyist is "hand zero," but adding a
                     superscript zero to every siglum would be redundant, since it can be inferred
                     from the absence of a numeral that the original copyist is meant.</p>

                  <p>In some cases, it is not necessary, possible, or desirable to make such a sharp
                     distinction between hands. It may be sufficient instead to refer to hands other
                     than the original copyist with the general <foreign xml:lang="la">manus
                        recentior</foreign>, or <hi rend="italic">m.r.</hi> ("a later hand").
                     However the editor decides to represent the activities of a manuscript's hands
                     and the relationships between them, an explanation should be provided in the
                     preface.</p>

                  <p>In sum, for the purposes of these guidelines, manuscript hands are witnesses,
                     and the following scheme should be used to indicate them: <list>
                        <item>siglum without a superscript number (= "hand zero"): the original
                           copyist.</item>
                        <item>siglum with superscript 1 (= "hand one"): a hand that wrote in the

               <p>In traditional printed editions, the lemma may appear in the apparatus criticus
                  for the purpose of disambiguation (e.g., if there are two instances of the word in
                  the same line or if the degree of variance makes it difficult to infer the lemma),
                  but more often the lemma must be inferred. This can lead to confusion and
                  frustration, particularly in readers not used to navigating a critical edition.
                  Moreover, variant readings are sequestered from the edition text and displayed at
                  the bottom of the page, an arrangement that can lead to false impressions about
                  the certainty and reliability of the edition text.</p>

               <p>In the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html"
                     >TEI's model for the critical apparatus</ref>, which is the basis for these
                  guidelines, each entry includes the lemma and its variants. How that information
                  is displayed or printed is a separate issue, but at least the relationship between
                  the lemma and the variant readings is explicitly encoded. In digital
                  representations of an edition encoded according to the guidelines presented here,
                  readings may be swapped into or out of the edition text, but the editor's
                  determination about what is the lemma and what is a variant remains encoded to
                  preserve the argument the edition makes about the text. In this way, it is
                  possible for readers to experience many versions of a text in addition to the
                  edition's reference state (i.e., its default setting). The variety of readings
                  depends on what the editor decides to encode, and it is expected that those
                  decisions will be explained in the preface.</p>

               <p>The patterns displayed below are designed to handle the various kinds of
                  information conveyed in a typical apparatus criticus, including readings <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">ante correctionem</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">in
                     rasura</foreign>, among other paleographical and editorial details. They were
                  developed through a joint effort of the Digital Latin Library project and
                  LombardPress. Contributors: Samuel J. Huskey, Hugh Cayless, Tom Elliott, Jeffrey

               <head>Basic Reporting of a Variant Reading</head>
               <p>The most basic type of apparatus entry reports only a variant reading, without
                  editorial comment or a description of palaeographical details. The pattern is as
                  follows:</p>

               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <app>
                     <lem><!-- text of lemma goes here --></lem>
                     <rdg wit="#siglum"><!-- text of variant reading goes here --></rdg>
                  </app>
               </egXML>

               <p>In other words, <gi>app</gi> begins the apparatus entry, followed by <gi>lem</gi>,
                  which contains the lemma for the entry. The lemma may be a single word or phrase
                  or the omission of a word or phrase. The variant reading follows, contained in
                     <gi>rdg</gi>. The attribute <att>wit</att> lists the witness for the variant.
                  The hash or pound sign (#) before the siglum for the witness indicates that the
                  witness has been described elsewhere in the edition, making it possible to
                  retrieve that information through a link to it, if desired.</p>

               <p>If there is more than one witness for a reading, the sigla should be values for
                     <att>wit</att> separated by spaces.</p>

               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <app>
                     <lem><!-- text of lemma goes here --></lem>
                     <rdg wit="#A #B #C"><!-- text of reading goes here --></rdg>
                  </app>
               </egXML>

               <p>If there is more than one variant reading to be reported, new <gi>rdg</gi>
                  elements should be added for each one.</p>

               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <app>
                     <lem><!-- text of lemma goes here --></lem>
                     <rdg wit="#A #B #C"><!-- text of reading goes here --></rdg>
                     <rdg wit="#D #E #F"><!-- text of reading goes here --></rdg>
                  </app>
               </egXML>

               <p>If it is desirable to indicate that a variant appears in both a manuscript and a
                  modern edition or other source, the same pattern applies, with the addition of
                     <att>source</att>.</p>

                        ><!-- text of reading goes here --></rdg>

               </egXML>

               <div xml:id="basic-entry-examples">
                  <head>Examples of basic apparatus criticus entries</head>
                  <p>At Calp. 1.2 (<foreign xml:lang="la">quamvis et madidis incumbant praela
                        racemis</foreign>), the manuscript <hi rend="bold">P</hi> has <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">praeda</foreign> where the lemma is <foreign xml:lang="la"
                        >praela</foreign>. In a traditional apparatus criticus, this would be
                     printed as follows: 2 praeda <hi rend="bold">P</hi>.</p>

                  <p>The following pattern demonstrates how to encode the entry in XML:</p>

                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <l n="2">quamvis et madidis incumbant <app>
                           <lem>praela</lem>
                           <rdg wit="#P">praeda</rdg>
                        </app> racemis</l>
                  </egXML>

                  <p>This encoding can be rendered in the traditional manner, or it can be used in
                     an interactive apparatus to swap the variant with the lemma in the main edition
                     text.</p>

                  <p>The lemma <foreign xml:lang="la">quamvis</foreign> in the same line
                     demonstrates how to indicate that a variant has more than one witness:</p>

                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <l n="2"><app>
                           <lem>quamvis</lem>
                           <rdg wit="#f #g #r #t">quatinus</rdg>
                        </app> et madidis incumbant praela racemis</l>
                  </egXML>

                  <p>The witnesses are listed here in chronological order, but an editor may wish to
                     use a different ordering principle. The order should be described and explained
                     in the preface.</p>

                  <p>The following example demonstrates how to encode a reading supported by a
                     witness and a source.</p>

                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

            <div xml:id="addition-deletions-omissions">
               <head>Additions, Deletions, and Omissions</head>

               <p>The following sections provide guidelines for representing additions, deletions,
                  and omissions in particular witnesses, as opposed to the tradition as a whole (for
                  which see the section "<ref target="#edition-text-symbols">Symbols Commonly Used
                     in the Text of a Critical Edition</ref>"). In most cases, additions, deletions,
                  and omissions will be encoded in combination with each other as part of a
                  correction, but since it is possible that they would be encountered by themselves
                  (e.g., addition of a reading in the margin), it seems best to treat them
                  individually here.</p>

               <p>There are two methods of encoding additions and deletions: prose description and
                  semantic markup. Both are demonstrated in each of the following sections.</p>

                  <head>Omission</head>
                  <p>This section explains how to encode omission of text from a witness.</p>

                  <p>For example, the witness known as "P" has omitted the word <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">pecus</foreign> from the following text: <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">securo custode pecus nocturnaque pastor</foreign>. The
                     traditional apparatus criticus indicates the omission as follows:</p>

                  <p> pecus <hi rend="italic">om.</hi>
                     <hi rend="bold">P</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>In these guidelines, the omission is represented by a so-called "self-closing"
                        <gi>rdg</gi> (&lt;rdg/&gt;):</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <l>securo custode <app>
                           <lem>pecus</lem>
                           <rdg wit="#P"/>
                        </app> nocturnaque pastor</l>
                  </egXML>

                  <p>The same model applies to the omission of an entire line of verse, but in that
                     case <gi>app</gi> has <att>type</att>="lineOmission" and <gi>lem</gi> contains
                     the entire line, with the omission marked by a self-closing <gi>rdg</gi>:</p>

                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <app type="lineOmission">

                  <p>This will be displayed in the apparatus criticus as <quote><hi rend="italic"

            <div xml:id="corrections">
               <head>Corrections</head>

               <p>Correction has been discussed at length in the section "<ref
                     target="apparatus-criticus-terms">Concepts and Definitions</ref>." In short,
                  for the purposes of these guidelines, "correction" describes any attempt by the
                  original copyist or some other hand to alter a witness' reading, whether or not
                  the result matches the lemma of the current edition.</p>

               <p>Since the amount of detail to report is a matter for editors to decide, this
                  section describes a range of options for encoding corrections. All are acceptable
                  and will be supported by the LDLT's viewer application. When determining the
                  method to use, editors should bear in mind not only the amount of detail necessary
                  to communicate the nature of a correction, but also the functionality they want
                  their edition to support. The subsections below include discussions intended to
                  help editors make those determinations.</p>
               <div xml:id="correction-as-metadata">
                  <head>Correction as Metadata</head>

                  <p>Editors have devised creative ways of reporting corrections. The simplest
                     method is to report readings and annotate them with <foreign xml:lang="la">ante
                        correctionem</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la">post correctionem</foreign>,
                     or something similar. Another method is to add abbreviations for those phrases
                     as superscript notations on manuscript sigla (e.g., B<hi rend="superscript"
                        >ac</hi>, B<hi rend="superscript">pc</hi>). Sometimes it is necessary to
                     provide more detail about the method of correction, in which cases editors will
                     either describe the correction (e.g., t <hi rend="italic">exp.</hi>, r <hi
                        rend="italic">add. s.l.</hi>) or they will try to represent it
                     typographically (e.g., referṭ<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>e). Some rely on
                     superscript notation for all of these details (e.g., P<hi rend="superscript"
                        >csl</hi> = P <foreign xml:lang="la">correctio supra lineam</foreign>).</p>

                  <p>The different methods have advantages and disadvantages, but they all
                     effectively demonstrate that correction is a complex subject. Even the word
                     "correction" is problematic, since it can refer to the result of a process or
                     the process itself. If correction is to be represented faithfully in a digital
                     critical edition, we must analyze the information it conveys.</p>

                  <p>Aside from judgments about correctness, "correction" necessarily involves at
                     least four kinds of information: <list>
                        <item>an original reading</item>
                        <item>an altered form of the original reading</item>
                        <item>an agent or agents (i.e., the correcting hand or hands)</item>
                        <item>a method or methods of correction (i.e., deletion, addition above the
                           line, etc.)</item>
                     </list> Since the primary mission of an apparatus criticus is to report variant
                     readings, it is useful to think of the original reading and the altered form of
                     the original reading as the data and the information about agency and method as
                     metadata, or data about the data. But "original form" and "altered form" can be
                     analyzed further into states (original and altered), leaving two readings as
                     the data, with the following metadata:<list>
                        <item>state (original, altered)</item>
                        <item>correspondence (showing that the two readings are related to each
                           other through correction)</item>
                        <item>agent or agents</item>
                        <item>method or methods of correction</item>
                     </list></p>

                  <p>Not all of these metadata items will be required in every instance. The
                     original reading, for example, will obviously not have an agent (beyond the
                     witness to the reading) or a method of correction, but it will have a state
                     (original). It might have a correspondence to show that it is related to its
                     altered form, if one is provided, but it is not always necessary to report the
                     altered form. For example, if the altered form is the lemma in the main text of
                     the edition, it is sufficient to report the original form with a note that it
                     was corrected (the inference being that it was corrected to the "correct" form
                     of the lemma if no other form is reported). Similarly, it may not be necessary
                     to report the method of correction.</p>

                  <p>With regard to reporting the method of correction, the LDLT supports two
                     approaches, prose description and typographical depiction. The former simply
                     requires a succinct description of the correction (e.g., t <hi rend="italic"
                        >add. s.l.</hi>).</p>

                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <app>
                        <lem>vocas</lem>
                        <rdg wit="#E" xml:id="rdg-voca">voca</rdg>
                        <rdg wit="#E1" xml:id="rdg-vocat">vocat</rdg>

                  </egXML>

                  <p>The latter requires the correction to be encoded using techniques described
                     elsewhere in these guidelines:</p>

                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <app>
                        <lem>vocas</lem>
                        <rdg wit="#E" xml:id="rdg-voca">voca</rdg>
                        <rdg wit="#E1" xml:id="rdg-vocat">vocat</rdg>
                        <witDetail wit="#E1" target="#rdg-vocat" type="correction"
                           corresp="#rdg-voca">voca<add place="above">t</add></witDetail></app>
                  </egXML>

                  <p>Editors should declare in the preface which method(s) they have adopted so that
                     users will know to what extent the data about corrections is structured.</p>

                  <p>Classifying information related to correction as metadata supports a variety of
                     functions. In addition to preserving the ability to swap readings in an out of
                     the text described elsewhere in these guidelines, it will allow querying of
                     information specific to certain witnesses, listing of all apparatus entries
                     involving correction, filtering of variants with corrected forms, and more.</p>

                  <p>The following sections demonstrate how correction information should be encoded
                     to take advantage of this functionality.</p>

            <div xml:id="conjecture-and-emendation">
               <head>Conjecture and Emendation</head>

               <p>As explained in the section <ref target="#apparatus-criticus-terms">Concepts and
                     Definitions</ref>, conjectures are readings that are not supported by
                  documentary evidence, but are instead proposed by someone and considered by the
                  editor to be worthy of inclusion in a critical edition. A conjecture is called an
                  emendation if it is adopted as the official reading of a particular criticial
                  edition's main text. In other words, for the purposes of these guidelines, an
                  emendation is a successful conjecture. But above all, conjectures and emendations
                  are readings, and they are encoded as such in LDLT editions.</p>

               <p>Traditionally, conjectures and emendations have been annotated in various ways in
                  critical editions (e.g., <foreign xml:lang="la">ci.</foreign> or <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">conj.</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="la">coniecit</foreign>,
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">em.</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">emend.</foreign>
                  for <foreign xml:lang="la">emendavit</foreign>, among others). They should be
                  annotated in digital editions, too, both to facilitate their identification, and
                  to enable features such as filtering and searching for them. The annotation is
                  accomplished with <att>type</att>.</p>

               <p>Since an emendation is a conjecture that has been adopted for the main text of the
                  edition, only <gi>lem</gi> can have <att>type</att> with value "emendation." It
                  could be inferred that a lemma with <att>source</att> only is an emendation, but
                  in the interest of being explicit, an emendation should be annotated accordingly.
                  Conversely, only <gi>rdg</gi> may have <att>type</att> with value "conjecture." It
                  could be inferred that a reading with <att>source</att> only is a conjecture, but
                  it is best to be explicit in the identification.</p>

               <p>The following example demonstrates how to encode both an emendation and a
                  conjecture.</p>

               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <app>
                     <lem source="#Haupt1854" type="emendation" xml:id="lem-plenumque"
                        >plenumque</lem>
                     <rdg wit="#ω" source="#edd.">primumque</rdg>
                     <rdg source="#Baehr." type="conjecture">rivumque</rdg>
                     <rdg source="#CSchenkl" type="conjecture">pronumque</rdg>
                     <note target="#lem-plenumque">prob. <ref taret="#Keene">Keene</ref> et <ref
                           target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref></note>
                  </app>
               </egXML>

               <p>This encoding will produce the following output: plenumque] <hi rend="italic"
                     >conj</hi>. Haupt (<hi rend="italic">prob</hi>. Keene <hi rend="italic">et</hi>
                  Schenkl), primumque <hi rend="bold">ω</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">edd</hi>., rivumque Baehr., pronumque C. Schenkl.</p>

               <p>If someone has proposed multiple conjectures, they should be contained in
                     <gi>rdgGrp</gi> with <att>type</att> and value "conjecture."</p>

               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <app>
                     <lem>pallenti</lem>
                     <rdgGrp type="conjecture">
                        <rdg source="#Heins.">ridenti</rdg>
                        <rdg source="#Heins.">varianti</rdg>
                        <rdg source="#Heins.">vernanti</rdg>
                        <rdg source="#Heins.">roranti</rdg>
                     </rdgGrp>
                  </app>
               </egXML>

               <p>This would be displayed as pallenti] ridenti <hi rend="italic">vel</hi> varianti
                     <hi rend="italic">vel</hi> vernanti <hi rend="italic">vel</hi> roranti <hi
